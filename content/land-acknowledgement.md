# Land acknowledgement

Before beginning the workshop, we'd like to acknowledge the indigenous lands where we are located.    

The University of Manitoba is located on Treaty 1 territory: the original ancestral lands of Anishinaabeg, Cree, Oji-Cree, Dakota, and Dene peoples, and on the homeland of the MÃ©tis Nation.

We are also home to the National Centre for Truth & Reconciliation (NCTR) which is the physical and digital archive for all of the material collected by the Truth and Reconciliation Commission of Canada. Their objective is to teach Canadians about the history and legacy of the Residential School System in Canada. The NCTR was selected to be housed at the University of Manitoba in Winnipeg for a variety of reasons; one of which being Winnipeg's central location in Canada, and also the fact that Winnipeg has been a significant geographical meeting place for Indigenous peoples for centuries. 

Take a moment to explore [native-land.ca](https://native-land.ca/) so that you can visualize the indigenous territories, languages, and treaties in your area. We feel it is especially important for those of us who work with spatial and geographic information to understand the diverse histories of the lands we find ourselves on.
