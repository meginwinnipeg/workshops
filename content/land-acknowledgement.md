# Land acknowledgement

The University of Manitoba is located on Treaty 1 territory: the original ancestral lands of Anishinaabeg, Cree, Oji-Cree, Dakota, and Dene peoples, and on the homeland of the Métis Nation. To acknowledge this territory is to recognize its longer history, one predating the establishment of Winnipeg and Canada as a significant geographical meeting place for Indigenous peoples for centuries.

As a settler, I recognize that I have been a part of settler-colonizer complicity. I feel it is especially important for those of us who work with spatial and geographic information to understand the diverse histories of the lands we find ourselves on and make sure we are not erasing those that fall outside of our Eurocentric worldview.
