## Key points from slides:

- GIS is any system used to analyze, capture or work with geospatial data and can ingest three main types of data: tabular, vector and raster.  
- Different tools within the software are only able to work with specific data types.  
- Outside of classroom instruction common processes undertaken by education professionals conducting GIS work include:  
    - Facilities management (capacity, infrastructure, emergency planning).
    - Administration
        - Comparison between schools, boards and other benchmarks
		- Location attributes (student:teacher ratios, funding, enrollment)
		- Transportation networks
		- Policy informed by community attributes
	- Stakeholder feedback via participatory tools
- ArcGIS Online is a proprietary tool that is great for entry level users.    
- Many visualization tools can be found linked from the [data visualization subject guide](https://libguides.lib.umanitoba.ca/viz).
