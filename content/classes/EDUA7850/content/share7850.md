## 0. **Step Back**:  
While we have had the purpose of creating a StoryMap in the back of our minds while we were creating our maps, letâ€™s step back take stock of what we have, and make a concrete plan.  


What do we have?  
- Layer of schools + populations  
- Layer of school divisions 
- Layer of census data by Dissemination area  
- Map of schools by population 
- Map of Winnipeg DAs by unemployment rates. 
- Other content you collected on your own. 

Map out your idea:

## 1. Access the **StoryMap**:  
1. Log-in to the [GISHub](https://univmb.maps.arcgis.com/)  

2. Navigate or use the waffle button on your Home screen to get to the StoryMaps landing page (https://storymaps.arcgis.com/stories) and ensure you are signed in.   

3. The landing page has the same elements as ArcGIS Online, but organized in a different way.  
Numbers 1-4 describe them.  
    1. Account settings  
    2. Create a new story  
    3. List of personal/ available content  
    4. Training materials  
![AGOL workspace](img/share/step1a.PNG)<br>  

4. Select the **New Story** button to start a new story from scratch. Your Story will save automatically as you work.  
 
5. Your screen should look something like:  
![AGOL workspace](img/share/step1b.PNG)<br>  

 
## 2. **Explore** the StoryMap workspace.  
1. Numbers 1-5 describe the different elements available:  
    1. Add a **title** and **subtitle** by typing directly into the browser.  
    2. Add a **new object/row** to your story. 
    3. Add **media** to the row.  
    4. Adjust the **design** of your story by selecting a pre-set (colour/font/layout) or create a template of your own.  
    5. Sharing options to **Preview** and **Publish** your story.  
![AGOL workspace](img/share/step2a.PNG)<br>  

2. On your own:  
    1. Decide what you want to use as a **cover image**  and load it.     
    2. Adjust the **Design** to see how the look of your workspace changes.  
    3. Add a creative **title/subtitle** to catch the attention of your audience.  
3. I selected to use a _Full_ cover and the _Summit_ theme for simplicity.  
![AGOL workspace](img/share/step2b.PNG)<br>  

4. This is where I would usually step back and assess the font and colour choices of my theme in relation to the project:  
- Is the colour of the theme cohesive with my background image?  
- Is personality of the font appropriate for my audience and purpose?  
- How much time do I have? Is one of the default templates good enough, or should I create a custom theme?  


## 3. Add a **new object** to your StoryMap.  
1. Hover your mouse below your cover page block, a green plus sign will appear.  
2. Clicking on the plus sign reveals all the different objects that can be added to your page.  
![AGOL workspace](img/share/step3a.PNG)<br>  
 
3. In the plan I made, I said I was going to add a text box with a locator map to the left (you can always reorder the rows later).  
    1. Select the **Map** option. You can add a map you have created using ArcGIS Online, or add an Express Map to create one on the fly.
	2. Click the **Express Map** ![AGOL workspace](img/share/step3ab.PNG) option in the top right corner of your screen.  
	3. Zoom the map to the appropriate level to create a locator map for the city of Winnipeg to help people get their bearings. Click **Done** once you are satisfied.  
	![AGOL workspace](img/share/step3abc.PNG)
    4. Once the **Map** is added you will see the **options** by hovering over its top.  
    5. I am going to select the **float** option so that I can add descriptive text next to it.  
    ![AGOL workspace](img/share/step3b.PNG)<br>  
    6. Next I will add my **Text** by clicking the _green plus sign_ that appears on the top right corner of my newly added map. Hovering over each element provides a description.  
![AGOL workspace](img/share/step3c.PNG)<br>  
 
    5. Copy and paste some text from a Lorem Ipsum generator. You can see that you can format text as headers, lists and add hyperlinks.  
4. Step back and assess. In my case, my block looks like:  
![AGOL workspace](img/share/step3d.PNG)<br>  

 
## 4. Add an **immersive object** to your StoryMap.  
When we scroll to the bottom of the list of objects we can add to our page there are 3 immersive options: slideshow, sidecar and map tour. As all the maps we have created are of the same area and scale, vertical sidecar scrolling will be a good fit.  
![AGOL workspace](img/share/step4a.PNG)<br>  

1. Add a sidecar row to your page by clicking the green plus sign below the row you just added and selecting the **sidecar** option.  
2. Select whichever layout you prefer, and then click _Done_, your new sidecar wizard will open.  
3. Explore the sidecar builder. Numbers 1-4 describe the different elements:  
    1. **Add media**: where you add the background image/map  
    2. **Add text**: where you add your descriptive text, you can also add images, other maps, videos etc.  
    3. **Add slide**: where you add a new object inside the immersive viewer.  
    4. **Your slides**: the content that is already loaded into the viewer.  
![AGOL workspace](img/share/step4b.PNG)<br>  

 
## 5. Add a **map** to your sidecar.  
1. Click the **Add media** button at the top of the window (1) and then select the **map** option.  
2. Your available ArcGIS Online maps appear as options to select. I am going to add my _Inspection Status_ map.   
3. After adding my map, the dialogue changes to a map preview:  
![AGOL workspace](img/share/step5a.PNG)<br>  

4. I know that I will have a text box floating on the left side of my page, so I will pan and zoom my map to position it something like:  
![AGOL workspace](img/share/step5b.PNG)<br>  
 
5. Select the gear option at the top of your map to display map properties, here you can control how the user interacts with your map.  
6. In my case I want to allow for map navigation (scrolling and panning) and also show the legend, so I have toggled these options _on_.  
![AGOL workspace](img/share/step5c.PNG)<br>  
 
7. Click _Place Map_ in the bottom right corner of your screen to finish adding your map.  
8. I will also add **context text** to the textbox by clicking the green plus sign and selecting the **text** option. I am copy + pasting the _The Project_ text from the workshop text document.  
9. Slide 1 of my sidecar now looks something like:  
![AGOL workspace](img/share/step5d.PNG)<br>  

10. Continue to populate your sidecar with the other maps you have created. There is a link to a video, and some other images that you can try adding to your sidecar/ text boxes as well.  
11. Play around with other adding other elements to your StoryMap, feel free to go beyond the content/text I have provided you in the workshop folder.  


## 6. Publish and share  
Once you have finished adding content and are happy with your results, you can select the **Publish** option at the top of your screen. The builder will prompt you if any components of your StoryMap do not have the appropriate sharing settings to be displayed properly.<br>

1. Ensure all elements are shared with the class group (EDUA7850).  
![AGOL workspace](img/share/step6a.PNG)<br>  
  
**Note** It is up to you to know the permissions level on the data/ media you have embedded in your StoryMap and not break copyright.


## 7. Update **metadata** and ensure you have properly **shared** to submit your file to Dr. Yoon.
1. Navigate to the **content** area of your workspace.  
2. Select your StoryMap to open up the item description page.  
![AGOL workspace](img/share/step7a.PNG)<br>  
 
3. Update the previously highlighted sections as follows:  
    1. _Description_: Describe your project  
    2. _Terms of Use_: Let people know this is a student project for the EDUA7850 course  
    3. _Tags_:  **7850_Final**  
    4. _Share_: Under group sharing ensure the **EDUA7850** group is selected  


Congratulations! You made it through!
