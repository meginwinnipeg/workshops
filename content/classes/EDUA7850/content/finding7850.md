## Key points from slides:

- Data can be categorized as open or proprietary
- Step back and consider the authoritative body that would have created the data you are looking for.  
- If you are going to make a map, your project will need a geographic bounding unit and microdata that can be tied together.  
- Make use of the materials available to you as a student while at UM:    
    - Subject Guide data  
    - GISHub  
- Accessing quality data can take time. Be kind to your future self.
