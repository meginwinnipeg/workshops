## 0. **Step Back**:  
While we have had the purpose of creating a StoryMap in the back of our minds while we were creating our maps, let’s step back take stock of what we have, and make a concrete plan.  

Our Scenario:  
_You have been hired as the GIS intern in the Public Works Department at the City of Winnipeg. The arborists have been doing a lot of work in King’s Park and entering information into their new tree inventory system. Your job is to create some materials for the public so they can see how their tax dollars are being used._  

What do we have?  
- Map of Trees by Genus  
- Heat Map of Tree Distribution  
- Map of trees by Trunk Diameter  
- Summary statistics about trees in Kings Park 
- Workshop folder that includes: images of trees and park elements, a locator map for the park, some text to copy and paste, data csv files.
