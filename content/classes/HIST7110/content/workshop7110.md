	![AGOL workspace](img/find/step5.PNG)<br>  

## 0. **Summary**:  
In this step we will be exploring the workshop content and making a plan for our story.  
This includes:  
- Provided workshop data  
- Organizational data  
- Data attributes  

---

## 1. Access your **Content** workspace:  
1. Navigate to UM's ArcGIS Online Portal (https://univmb.maps.arcgis.com) and ensure you are signed in.  
2. Access the **Content** area by clicking on that option in the top navigation.  
![AGOL workspace](img/integrate/step1a.PNG)<br>  


## 2. **Explore** the Content Panel:  
Numbers 1-4 illustrate the locations of the following elements:  

1. **Personal content** (includes all data and objects you have created)  
2. **Filters** (allows you to easily limit the things that show up in your content area)  
3. **Create New** (one of many ways to create/ add content to your workspace)  
4. **Available content** (items that have been shared to you through groups, University of Manitoba or ESRI’s Living Atlas.)  

	![AGOL workspace](img/integrate/step2.PNG)<br>  
  

## 3. View **Organization** data options:  

1. Click on **My Organization** in the blue Content navigation bar.  
2. This brings up data that has been shared at the Organizational level. Be aware, not all of it is available for reuse.  
![AGOL workspace](img/integrate/step3a.PNG)<br> 

3. Click on the **title** for _Street Outline: City of Winnipeg_ to see more details about the file.  
![AGOL workspace](img/integrate/step3b.PNG)<br>
   
4. Now we can see a _Description_ and the _Terms of Use_ for the file, as well as options to explore the data further.  
  ![AGOL workspace](img/integrate/step3c.PNG)<br>
 
5. Return to your **personal content** page.  

## 4. View **Group** data options:  

1. Click on **My Groups** in the blue Content navigation bar.  
2. This brings up items that have been shared at the Group level, I have shared four (4) maps and one feature layer with you.  
3. Click on the **GenusMapKP_2200** map that has been shared with you.  
![AGOL workspace](img/integrate/step4a.PNG)<br> 
 
  
## 5. **Open item** using the ArcGIS Online Map Viewer:  

1. Select the **Open in Map Viewer** option on the right side of your screen.  
![AGOL workspace](img/integrate/step5a.PNG)<br>
   
2. **Explore** the AGOL interface.  
Numbers 1-4 illustrate the locations of the following elements:  

    1. **Print, Share and Save** options    
    2. **Actions** (allows add new content to the map, change your base map, conduct simple analyses)  
    3. **Table of Contents** (properties options for individual layers such as : attributes, symbology and pop-up configuration)  
    4. **Your map** workspace    

	![AGOL workspace](img/integrate/step5b.PNG)<br>  
 
3. **Save** a copy of the map to your personal content area by selecting the **Save As** option. Add your initials to the end of the filename.  

  ![AGOL workspace](img/integrate/step5c.PNG)<br>  
 

## 6. **Configure pop-up** in your map for visual clarity.  
Right now, our pop-up contains a lot of extra information that our audience may not be interested in:  
![AGOL workspace](img/integrate/step6a.PNG)<br>
 
1. To edit, ensure the **Content** option is open in your Table of Contents and hover over the _TreeInventory_ layer to reveal its options.  
2. Select the three small dots on the right to open the **properties**, then the **Configure Pop-up** option,  
![AGOL workspace](img/integrate/step6b.PNG)<br>
 
3. Edit the title for the pop-up so that the label is _Common Name_:  instead of the feature service name.  
4. Select the blue **Configure Attributes** text to select which attributes you want to show up.  
![AGOL workspace](img/integrate/step6c.PNG)<br>

5. Click _OK_ to save your changes, now your pop-up should look something like:  
![AGOL workspace](img/integrate/step6d.PNG)<br>


## 7. **Center/ zoom** your map for reuse.  
We will be reusing this map later in a StoryMap. How your map looks here is how it will look when it is reused so we want to center it/ set base maps accordingly.  

1. To **center**, ensure the _Content_ option is open in your Table of Contents and hover over the _TreeInventory_ layer to reveal its options.  
2. Select the three small dots on the right to open the **properties**, then the **Zoom to** option,  
![AGOL workspace](img/integrate/step7a.PNG)<br>

3. Your map should now look something like:  
![AGOL workspace](img/integrate/step7b.PNG)<br>

4. We will now move over to the **Analysis** section to make more maps.  

## 0. **Housekeeping**:  
### **Project files**  
You can access all of your created projects by clicking on Open Project. Your project list can be organized by modification date, title, row count, and other metadata you can supply (such as subject, descripton, tags, or creator). To edit the fields you see here, click About to the left of each project. There you can edit a number of available fields. You can also see the project ID that corresponds to the name of the folder in your work directory.  

### **Naming projects**  
You may have multiple projects from the same dataset, or multiple versions from sharing a project with another person. OpenRefine automatically generates a project name from the imported file, or “clipboard” when you use Clipboard importing. Project names don’t have to be unique, and OpenRefine will create many projects with the same name unless you intervene.  
<br>
You can edit a project's name when you create it or import it, and you can rename a project later by opening it and clicking on the project name at the top of the screen.  

### **Saving**
OpenRefine saves all of your actions (everything you can see in the Undo/Redo panel). Autosaving happens by default every five minutes.  
<br>
It doesn’t, however, save your facets, filters, or any kind of view you may have in place while you work. This includes the number of rows showing, and any sorting or column collapsing you may have done. A good rule of thumb is: if it’s not showing in Undo/Redo, you will lose it when you leave the project workspace.  
<br>
You can only save and share facets and filters, not any other type of view. To save current facets and filters, click Permalink. The project will reload with a different URL, which you can then copy and save elsewhere. This permalink will save both the facets and filters you’ve set, and the settings for each one (such as sorting by count rather than by name).  

### **Deleting projects**
You can delete projects, which will erase the project files from the workspace directory on your computer. This is immediate and cannot be undone.  

### **Sharing a project**  
Because OpenRefine only runs locally on your computer, you can’t have a project accessible to more than one person at the same time. The best way to collaborate with another person is to export and import projects that save all your changes, so that you can pick up where someone else left off.  

### **Create a project** 
An OpenRefine project is started by importing in some existing data - OpenRefine doesn’t allow you to create a dataset from nothing.  

No matter where your data comes from, OpenRefine won’t modify your original data source. It copies all the information from your input, creates its own project file, and stores it in your workspace directory.  
<br>
When you start OpenRefine, you’ll be taken to the Create Project screen. You’ll see on the left side of the screen that your options are to import data from your computer, the web, your clipboard, from a database or from Google Drive.  
<br>
If you supply two or more files for one project, the files’ rows will be loaded in the order that you specify, and OpenRefine will create a column at the beginning of the dataset with the source URL or file name in it to help you identify where each row came from. If the files have columns with identical names, the data will load in those columns; if not, the successive files will append all of their new columns to the end of the dataset.
<br>  
You cannot combine two datasets into one project by appending data within rows. You can, however, combine two projects later using functions.  

## 1. **Import** data to OpenRefine:  
When you start OpenRefine, it opens in your web browser. Don’t worry, your data won’t be connected to the internet – it is all kept locally on your computer. The web browser is just the interface used to run the program.  
Once you’ve launched the program, 
1. Click **Create Project** (1)
2. **Get data from… This computer** (2). Choose a file, navigate to your spreadsheet of choice (in this case, _Exercise2_)
3. Click **Next** (3).
![Create project](img/step1.PNG)
<br>
 
## 2. Project **preview** and **create** project
Once OpenRefine is ready to import the data, you will see a screen with _Configure Parsing Options_ at the top. You’ll see a preview of the first X rows and all identified columns. 
![Project preview](img/step2.PNG)
<br>
 
At the bottom of the screen, you will find options for telling OpenRefine how to process what it has found. You can tell it which row(s) to parse as column headers, as well as to ignore any number of rows at the top. You can also select a specific range of rows to work with, by discarding some rows at the top (excluding the header) and limiting the total number of rows it loads.  
OpenRefine tries to guess how to parse your data based on the file extension.  
**Encoding issues?**  
Look for character encoding issues at this stage. You may want to manually select an encoding, such as UTF-8, UTF-16, or ASCII, if OpenRefine does not display some characters correctly in the preview.  
**Note** that OpenRefine does not preserve any formatting, such as cell or text colour, that have been in the original data file. Hyperlinked text will be input as plain text, but OpenRefine will recognize links and make them clickable inside the project interface.  
Make sure the data looks right in the preview window, give your project a name (4), and click **Create Project** (5).
![Create project](img/step2a.PNG)
<br>
 
## 3. **Field type** transformations + **Undoing** an action
In many cases certain transformations or actions require a certain field type (string, number, date…). To change the field type of a column:  
Find the _Q3: AGE_ column. Right now the ages are being formatted as text.  
1. Select **dropdown arrow** beside the header (1) in the _Age_ column  
2. **Edit cells (2) -> Common transformations (3)> To Number (4)**  
![transformations](img/step3.PNG)  
<br>
 
Your age column should now look like the following with your ages now formatted in green as a numeric field.  
![field type](img/step3a.PNG)
<br>
 
** If at any point you want to undo an action, simple click the **Undo/Redo** (5) option on the left side of the page and select the **step** (6) you wish to revert to.
![undo action](img/step3b.PNG)
<br>
 

## 4. Upper and lower case **transformations**   
Sometimes your data will have inconsistent font casing between entries. This can be especially true if you’re combining datasets. We want all entries to be in title case: (eg. Canada, not CANADA, Canada, CAnaDA …). To apply this transformation:  
Find the _Q4: Country_ column.  
1. Select **dropdown arrow** beside the header (1) in the _Country_ column
2. **Edit cells (2) -> Common transformations (3)> To Titlecase (4)**
![to titlecase](img/step4.PNG)
<br>
 
![transform notification](img/step4a.PNG)
<br>
 
## 5: **Faceting**
**Faceting** provides you a snapshot of the entries in a particular column and allows you to filter down to particular rows. _I use it most to quickly highlight problems with the data._ The facet summarizes the cells in that column to give you a big picture on that column and allows you to filter to some subset of rows for which their cells in that column satisfy some constraint.  
Find the _Provinces_ column.  
1. Click the **down arrow** (1) and choose **Facet (2) -> Text facet (3)**  
![text facet](img/step5.PNG)
<br>
  
2. In the left margin, you’ll see a box containing every unique, distinct value in the Provinces column along with a count.  
![Province facet](img/step5a.PNG)
<br>
 
In this case, we have found that the provinces have been recorded in many different ways.  
***Note** that at any time, in any cell of the Facet box, or data cell in the Refine window, you have access to edit and can fix an error immediately. Refine will even ask you if you’d like to make that same correction to every value it finds like that one (or not).  
![edit facet](img/step5b.PNG)
<br>
  
But! There’s a smarter way…  
## 6: **Clustering**
**Clustering** uses AI and fuzzy matching to take a best guess at which pieces of text actually refer to the same thing. You can play with the **Method** and **Keying Function** to change the type of algorithm used to fuzzy match – but we’ll leave the defaults for this session.  
1. Click the **Cluster (1)** button in the Province facet on the left side of your screen.  
![Clustering](img/step6.PNG)
<br>
 
The **Values in Cluster** column shows you which values it thinks belong together.  
Take some time to go through the list and change values to be the the entire province name (ie: British Columbia) in title case.  
1. Click the checkbox in the **Merge? (2)** Column  
2. Edit the **New Cell Values (3)** as you see fit  
3. Click **Merge Selected and Close (4)**.  
![Cluster and edit](img/step6a.PNG)
<br>
 
Before we started merging, there were 43 different values in the Province column. Now there are 23, meaning we were able to automatically clean 20 values from the dataset!  
![Cleaned facet](img/step6b.PNG)
<br>
 
The program does a great job of matching the correct values, but as with anything automated, you should go through and look at your data for any discrepancies. For example, Alberta still has 3 entries because the algorithm doesn’t know that _AB, Albeqrrta,_ and _Alberta_ all refer to the same thing.  
At this point, you can either explore different clustering algorithms or merge these by hand using the edit option.  

## 7: **Join/ merge** columns
This question in the survey asked respondents to select their top three candy choices from a list of 8. We want to merge these columns into one with each value separated by a special character. In this case a '\|'.  
Find the _Q6 | First Fav Candy_ column.
1. Click the **down arrow** (1) and choose **Edit Column (2) -> Join columns (3)**  
![join columns](img/step7.PNG)
<br>
 
2. In the dialogue that opens enter the following:  
    1. Use the **checkboxes** to select the _Q6 (First, second and third fave candy)_ (4) columns  
    2. Type the **‘\|’** (5) as the **separator** in the first textbox
    3. Select the radio button to **create a new column**, call it **Q6: TOP 3 CANDIES** (6)
    4. Click **OK(7)** to join the columns
![Join dialogue](img/step7a.PNG)
<br>
![Join action](img/step7b.PNG)
<br>
 

## 8: **Split** column and **rename** fields
We can see the _Geotag_ column has both Latitude and Longitude in the same column separated by a comma. To visualize this data in a GIS, these need to be separate fields.   
Find the _Q8:Geotag_ column.
1. Click the **down arrow** (1) and choose Edit Column (2) -> Split into several columns (3) 
![split columns](img/step8.PNG)
<br>
  
    1. Split **by separator** (4)  
    2. Type a **comma** (5) into the text box as this is the divisor between the two fields.  
    3. Ensure **Guess cell type** (6) and **Remove this Column** (7)  
	4. Click **OK** (8) to move forward with splitting the column  
![split column error](img/step8a.PNG)
<br>
![Split column dialogue](img/step8b.PNG)
<br>
 
You can see that one of the records didn’t split. You can see this is because there was no comma separating the numbers in the original entry.  
2. Each new column is assigned a new name automatically. You can change the names by:
    1. Clicking the **dropdown arrow** (9) by the column name
    2. **Edit column (10) -> Rename this column (11)**
    3. Rename the column with the positive values _‘Latitude’_, and the one with the negative values _‘Longitude’_.
![rename column](img/step8c.PNG)
<br>
  
## 9. **Deleting** a column
Sometimes you will want to delete an entire column (use caution).  
Find the column titled _“Blank Column”_  
1. Clicking the **dropdown arrow** (1) by the column name
2. **Edit column (2) -> Remove this column (3)**

![remove column](img/step9.PNG)
<br>
  
## 10. **Advanced** OpenRefine Techniques
Open Refine has its own language referred to as GREL (General Refine Expression language) for performing custom operations. This would be similar to functions in Microsoft Excel and was created to resemble JavaScript. IE. _reinterpret()_ function to change column encoding or _uniques()_ to return an array with duplicates removed.

## 11. **Export** your data set
Remember, we aren’t making changes to your original dataset but to an OpenRefine project file. To export your cleaned data:  

1. Click the **Export** (1) option at the top of the page
2. Select **Comma-separated value (csv)** (2)
![export dataset](img/step11.PNG)
<br>
 
Congratulations! You made it through!
