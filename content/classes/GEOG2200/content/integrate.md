2. **Filters** (allows you to easily limit the things that show up in your content area)  
3. **Create New** (one of many ways to create/ add content to your workspace)  
4. **Available content** (items that have been shared to you through groups, University of Manitoba or ESRIâ€™s Living Atlas.)

## 6. **Configure pop-up** in your map for visual clarity.  
Right now, our pop-up contains a lot of extra information that our audience may not be interested in:

1. To edit, ensure the **Content** option is open in your Table of Contents and hover over the _TreeInventory_ layer to reveal its options.  
2. Select the three small dots on the right to open the **properties**, then the **Configure Pop-up** option,  
![AGOL workspace](img/integrate/step6b.PNG)<br>
 
3. Edit the title for the pop-up so that the label is _Common Name_:  instead of the feature service name.  
4. Select the blue **Configure Attributes** text to select which attributes you want to show up.  
![AGOL workspace](img/integrate/step6c.PNG)<br>

5. Click _OK_ to save your changes, now your pop-up should look something like:  
![AGOL workspace](img/integrate/step6d.PNG)<br>


## 7. **Center/ zoom** your map for reuse.  
We will be reusing this map later in a StoryMap. How your map looks here is how it will look when it is reused so we want to center it/ set base maps accordingly.  

1. To **center**, ensure the _Content_ option is open in your Table of Contents and hover over the _TreeInventory_ layer to reveal its options.  
2. Select the three small dots on the right to open the **properties**, then the **Zoom to** option,  
![AGOL workspace](img/integrate/step7a.PNG)<br>

3. Your map should now look something like:
