- GIS is any system used to analyze, capture or work with geospatial data and can ingest three main types of data: tabular, vector and raster.  
- Different tools within the software are only able to work with specific data types.  
- Popular processes undertaken by researchers conducting GIS work include:  
    - Digitization of historical maps/images  
    - Reconstruction of features from the past  
    - Georeferencing microdata  
    - Analyis of microdata to reveal themes or trends 
- ArcGIS Online is a proprietary tool that is great for entry level users.    
- Many visualization tools can be found linked from the [data visualization subject guide](https://libguides.lib.umanitoba.ca/viz).
