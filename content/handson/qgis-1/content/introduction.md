## Introduction

This introductory video will set the stage for what this workshop is all about.

[Why all world maps are wrong](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kIID5FDi2JQ)

### Key Points From the Video

* The surface of a sphere cannot be represented as a plane without distortion.
* A projection is the process by which we translate (or project) the spherical globe onto a flat surface.
* The object onto which maps are projected (i.e. cylinder, cone, or plane) affects the way the map appears.
* All map projections maintain certain properties while distorting others.
* Map projections can be useful, but they can also be misleading.

<summary>Who remembers which projection Google Maps uses and why?</summary>

Web Mercator </details>
<br>

- wherever you are on the map, up and down are north and south and left and right are west and east
- preserves angles of roads
- at large scales, the conformality of the projection preserves shapes, such as buildings
- objects around the equator are to scale relative to one another, while objects closer to the poles appear larger than they really are


If you're interested in reading more about this projection and some of the criticisms associated with using it, check out this Esri blog [It's Not Hip to Be Square](https://www.esri.com/arcgis-blog/products/arcgis-pro/mapping/mercator-its-not-hip-to-be-square/).

### What are the four properties that are either preserved or distorted depending on the projection?
