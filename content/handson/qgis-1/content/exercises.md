## Exercises

These exercises will be accomplished using ArcGIS Desktop. You should have already downloaded the software and the data we will use for this workshop.

If you haven't downloaded the data or software, that's okay. 

What's important is that you understand these different concepts and how they apply to working with spatial data.

In these exercises, I will demonstrate:

- How to recognize whether your data is in a geographic coordinate system
- How to find the spatial reference system of your dataset in that dataset's properties
- Projection on-the-fly and changing the projection properties of your data

### Exercise 1: What Coordinate System is my Data In?

### Exercise 2: Projecting On-the-Fly

### Exercise 3: Project Your Data
