### Coordinate Systems

- Geographic Coordinate System
  - Uses latitude and longitude and is expressed in decimal degrees
  
- Projected Coordinate System
  - Uses linear units
  - Projects the earth onto a flat surface
  
### Datums
 
 - A datum mathematically defines the shape and size of the earth and itâ€™s orientation in space
 - A **transformation** is a mathematical calculation used to convert coordinates referenced to one datum to coordinates referenced to another datum.
 
### Projections
 
* A projection is the process by which we translate (or project) the spherical globe onto a flat surface.
* The object onto which maps are projected (i.e. cylinder, cone, or plane) affects the way the map appears.
* All map projections maintain certain properties while distorting others.
