## Exercise 1: What coordinate system is my data in?

*1*{: .circle .circle-blue} From the folder where you downloaded and extracted the workshop data, open the **WGS1984** MXD (map).

*2*{: .circle .circle-blue} If there is a red exclamation point next to your dataset and nothing in the map, double-click on the shapefile in the Table of Contents.

*3*{: .circle .circle-blue} Under the **Source** tab, click on **Set Data Source**.

*4*{: .circle .circle-blue} Navigate to the **shapefiles** folder and select **CAN_WGS1984.shp** and click **OK**.

### Metadata

Notice the units in the lower right-hand corner of the map. 

These give you a clue as to whether this data is in a geographic or projected coordinate system.

Let's look at the properties, or metadata, of the dataset.

**Metadata** is data about data.

*5*{: .circle .circle-blue} Right-click the data in the Table of Contents pane and select **Properties**.

*6*{: .circle .circle-blue} Under the **Source** tab, scroll down in the **Data Source** window.

In the next exercise we'll go over projection on-the-fly.
