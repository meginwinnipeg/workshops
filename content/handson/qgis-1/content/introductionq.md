## Key points from slides:
- GIS is any system used to analyze, capture or work with geospatial data and can ingest three main types of data: tabular, vector and raster.  
- Different tools within the software are only able to work with specific data types.  
- Before embarking on a GIS project it is good to take stock of three main things: 
	- Context  
	- Resources  
	- Users  
- QGIS is the most robust entry level open-source GIS tool available.
- Many open tools can be found linked from the [data visualization subject guide](https://libguides.lib.umanitoba.ca/viz).
