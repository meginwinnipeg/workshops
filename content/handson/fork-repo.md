# Fork this workshop template
In this workshop we're going to duplicate this same workshop to your own GitHub account, then make some edits together. Can tinker and reuse this template anytime on your own account.

### *1*{: .circle .circle-blue} Go to [this workshop's GitHub repository](https://github.com/ubc-lib-geo/gis-workshop-waml-template){:target="_blank"}


### *2*{: .circle .circle-blue} Click on the option to Fork the repository
You'll see an option to Fork at the top right of your screen.   

![Fork location](../img/fork-location.png)

GitHub should pause for a moment while it copies the files from this repo to yours. When it's finished, you'll see a note that the repo has been "forked from [ubc-lib-geo/gis-workshop-waml-template](https://github.com/ubc-lib-geo/gis-workshop-waml-template)" in the top left.

You should also see your new repository which contains the following files and directories:
```
.
├── Rakefile
├── _config.yml
├── _includes
├── _layouts
├── _sass
├── _site
├── assets
├── bin
├── content
├── index.md
├── README.md
└── lib
```
In this workshop we're only going to be looking at a couple of these including the `_config.yml` file, the `README.txt` file, and the files inside the `content` folder.
{: .note}

### *3*{: .circle .circle-blue} Edit your _config.yml
We will need to publish this repository as a "GitHub Page", so that it's live at **[your GitHub username].github.io**. Right now it's configured to appear at **ubc-lib-geo.github.io**. Before we publish, we'll need to make some edits to our main site configuration file, '_config.yml'.

Step 1
{: .label .label-step}
Click on the `_config.yml` file in your list of files
{: .step}

Step 2
{: .label .label-step}
Select the **edit file** tool on the top left
{: .step}
![Edit file](../img/edit-file.png)

Step 3
{: .label .label-step}
Scroll down to line 28 and add your base hostname
{: .step}
You will want to make sure `https://ubc-lib-geo.github.io` is changed to `https://[YOUR GITHUB USERNAME].github.io`

Step 4
{: .label .label-step}
Next, go to line 40 and update the footer.
{: .step}
In line 40, you'll want to replace `ubc-lib-geo` with your own username. The result should look like this:  
`footer_content: <a href="https://github.com/your_username/gis-workshop-waml-template" target="_blank">View this workshop in GitHub</a>`  

Step 5
{: .label .label-step}
Add a commit message and save
{: .step}
Add something brief to your commit message – you can literally recycle the provided "Updated _config.yml" language – then press **Commit changes**.  

### *4*{: .circle .circle-blue} Go to your repository's Settings menu
We're almost ready to publish our workshop site! We can do that in our site's **Settings** which is found by clicking the top right tab.
![Edit file](../img/settings.png)

### *5*{: .circle .circle-blue} Publish your workshop site
Scroll down to the settings for GitHub Pages (almost to the bottom (Danger Zone!)). Under **Source** select your only branch (either `main` or `master`).  

Your site will take a moment (up to a couple of minutes) to build and propagate, but should soon be available at `https://[YOUR GITHUB USERNAME].github.io/gis-workshop-waml-template/`
