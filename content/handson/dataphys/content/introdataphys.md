## Key points from slides:

- _GIS:_ Geographic Information System, any system used to analyze, capture or work with information you would display with a map (aka geospatial data).   
- _Visual Encoding:_ Mapping inputs to visual cues. In data visualization/ mapping, this means constructing our data to be represented by visual elements like size, colour, length and placement.  
- Inputs can be tabular, vector, or raster. These different types will have different processes that you can do with them in the software.  
- Popular GIS processes and procedures are: digitization, reconstruction, georeferencing and analysis. 
- Before starting project it is good to step back and consider:  
	- your message  
    - your audience  
    - your data (requirements + structure)   
 - Visualization tools that Libraries support can be found linked from the [data visualization subject guide](https://libguides.lib.umanitoba.ca/viz).
