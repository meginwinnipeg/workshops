## Key points from slides:

-  Less is More  
    -  Don’t overwhelm with volume of words  
	-  Don't blind people with science; keep it simple  
-  High contrast – use high contrast between text and background   
-  Humans are easily overwhelmed by too much information. When deciding how to organize:   
	- Maximum of 6 points per slide  
    - 3-5 data classes per visual  
-  Many visualization tools can be found linked from the [data visualization subject guide](https://libguides.lib.umanitoba.ca/viz).
