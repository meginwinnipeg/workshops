## Failed Charts
<details>
<summary><strong>What is going on with my charts? They are showing up blank!</strong></summary> Try swapping the orientation of your rows and columns, the tool is often looking for things to be in a specific format.</details>

## Surprise Map Changes
<details>
<summary><strong>I loaded some AGOL maps into my Dashboard, and today they are at a different scale and not centred properly. What is happening? </strong></summary> The dashboard is referencing your ArcGIS Online maps, so if you make any edits or move the window in the map document, these changes will carry over to your dashboard. </details>

## Efficient Workflows
<details>
<summary><strong>I'm making a dashboard and it feels like I'm spending all my time formatting things and adjusting properties and starting over...</strong></summary>It is a fidgety process, the best thing to do is to make a plan based on the message you want to communicate before you start and then stick to it.</details>
