## Key points from slides:

- _Data Visualization:_ Display complex information in a way that makes it easier for your end user to explore or understand what you have done.  
- _Network Visualization:_ Displays complex relationships through an arrangement nodes and edges and can be categorized as physical or logical. A network can be also be represented using a mathematical notation with roots in graph theory. 
- Data is structured as nodes and edges with attributes of directionality, weight etc.  
- Before starting project it is good to step back and consider:  
	- your message  
    - your audience  
    - your data (requirements + structure)   
- Kumu is a great online tool with a robust free tier, for advanced options try Gephi.
