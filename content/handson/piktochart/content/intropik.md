## Key points from slides:

- _Data Visualization:_ Display complex information in a way that makes it easier for your end user to explore or understand what you have done.  
- _Infographic:_ A collection of imagery, charts, and <strong>minimal text</strong> that gives an easy-to-understand overview of a topic or distills a theme.  
- Breaking things down into the following four categories will help you select the appropriate graphic type for your data.
	- Comparison  
    - Composition  
    - Distribution  
    - Relationship  
- Before starting project it is good to step back and consider:  
	- your message  
    - your audience  
    - your data (requirements + structure)   
- Font and colour convey personality, select appropriately and keep it simple.
- Piktochart and Visme are online tools with a robust free tier.  
- Many visualization tools can be found linked from the [data visualization subject guide](https://libguides.lib.umanitoba.ca/viz).
