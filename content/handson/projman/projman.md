# Data Foundations: Working with structured data  

## Objectives:

This session lays the groundwork for researchers who want to visualize their research and are looking for a practical approach to the project management and data literacy skills needed to be proficient in this area. Attendees will have the opportunity to interact with various visualization software and data types at different stations, and we will end with a hands-on exercise of planning a personal map to be created in the follow-up session.
By the end of this workshop, participants will:  
- Explore how project management can intersect with research visualization  
- Gain an overview of structured data and the software used to visualize them  
- Create a project management plan to set up the hands-on portion of the following session
