## Key points from slides:

- **Data Visualization:** Display complex information in a way that makes it easier for your end user to explore or understand what you have done.  
- **Data Dashboard:** A graphical user interface providing easily digestible views of a particular process or objective.  
- Breaking things down into the following four categories will help you select the appropriate graphic type for your data.
	- Comparison  
    - Composition  
    - Distribution  
    - Relationship  
- Before startiing project it is good to take stock of your requirements to help you select the appropriate tool: 
	- Your expertise - be kind to your future self;  
    - Purpose - exploratory vs. explanatory;  
    - Audience - expertise, mediation;  
    - Data requirements - size, residency, privacy...  
- PowerBI and Tableau are the most robust entry level dashboard tools available.  
- Many visualization tools can be found linked from the [data visualization subject guide](https://libguides.lib.umanitoba.ca/viz).
