## Key points from slides:
- GIS is any system used to analyze, capture or work with geospatial data and can ingest three main types of data: tabular, vector and raster.  
- Different tools within the software are only able to work with specific data types.  
- Before embarking on a GIS project it is good to take stock of your objective to help you select the appropriate tool: 
	- Visualize + Contextualize: Google Earth  
	- Perform Analysis: QGIS  
	- Visualize & Share: Leaflet, mapbox.js, Carto...  
- QGIS is the most robust entry level open-source GIS analysis tool available.
- Many visualization tools can be found linked from the [data visualization subject guide](https://libguides.lib.umanitoba.ca/viz).
