# PowerBI FAQs

*Click the arrows to reveal the answers.*

## Software versions
<details>
<summary><strong>I am using the PowerBI app in my web browser and can't find the data cleaning menus. I could find them when I was in the Lab...</strong></summary>The PowerBI app (SaaS) has much less functionality than the Desktop version. Data transformation options are only available in Desktop.</details>
<br>

## Failed Visualizations
<details>
<summary><strong>This is a disaster, nothing is showing up the way I am expecting it to.</strong></summary> Before you begin to visualize <em>clean data</em> is critical. This means no merged fields, floating legends or rogue images. Ensure each column has a descriptive header to help you navigate.</details>  
<br>

## Data Classification
<details>
<summary><strong>My data is continuous, but the options I want to use for visualization are greyed out. What's going on?</strong></summary> You probably haven't set the correct data type, format or summarization on that particular field. Make adjustments in the <em>data</em> panel.</details>  
<br>

## Joining data
<details>
<summary><strong>I am trying to use a Merge Query to join two tables but it isn't working!</strong></summary>Often it is the data types that will be causing the issue. Make sure the fields you are trying to join on <em>match in type</em> (ie. text, decimal...). Also ensure there are no <em>errors</em> in your data (nulls etc). </details>
